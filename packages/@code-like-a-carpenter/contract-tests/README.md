API Blueprint is (usually) easier to write than OpenAPI and there's already
tooling out there to turn it into tests. Unfortunately, it's difficult to debug
when something fails (especially in a before hook), doesn't make it easy to run
a specific test, and is just generally frustrating.

Its parser and compiler, however, are separate from its CLI, so this package use
them to generate Jest tests from your API Blueprint.

## Install

```bash
npm i @code-like-a-carpenter/contract-tests
```

## Usage

Create your jest test file, but instead of writing explicit tests, import
`buildContractTests` and pass it your API Blueprint and your API base url.

> Make sure to pass the full path to your API Blueprint file, not a relative
> path.

```ts
import path from 'node:path';

import {buildContractTests} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/contract-tests';

describe('contract tests', () => {
    buildContractTests({
        baseUrl: process.env.API_URL,
        blueprint: path.join(__dirname, 'api.apib'),
    });
});
```
