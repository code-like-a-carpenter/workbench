## Install

```bash
npm i @code-like-a-carpenter/exception
```

## Usage

This class doesn't do much on its own, but it starts as a common point for other
exceptions to extend from. Most usefully, however, `captureException` from
[`@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry`](../telemetry) will look for the `telemetry`
field and attach any discovered properties as attributes to the span.
