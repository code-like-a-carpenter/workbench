## Install

```bash
npm i @code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry
```

## Usage

## captureException

Helper function that attaches a thrown exception to the current span and adds
other interesting span details. It takes two arguments, the exception and
whether or not it escaped its current span. If you rethrow, `escaped` should be
true, if you handle it, `escaped` should be false. If it's worth capturing an
exception when escaped is false, then it's probably worth alerting on.

If you're using `@code-like-a-carpenter/lambda-handlers`, you probably don't
need to think about `captureException`.

### Sentry

This package automatically initializes [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and wires it
into `captureException`. This really isn't ideal as so far there's not obvious
way to opt-out of this behavior if you're not using Sentry.

At time of writing, Sentry's behavior induces `aws-sdk` v2 to be bundled, so
you'll want to exclude it using your bundler config.

### runWith\*

This packages contains several functions run a function inside a new
OpenTelemetry span. In most cases, you'll want `runWithNewSpan` and in some
cases, you'll want `runWithNewSpanFromContext` (see its in-line docs for
specifics). `runWithSpan` is a lower-level function that is used by the other
two and probably won't be used directly by consumers, but is exported for
completeness.

```ts
import {runWithNewSpan} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry';

export async function handler(...args) {
    const result = await runWithNewSpan(
        'handler',
        {attrs: {'com.example.foo': 'bar'}},
        async () => {
            return await doSomething(...args);
        }
    );
    return result;
}
```

### withTelemetry

> Note that `withTelemetry` is on its way to deprecation and so you should
> prefer one of `instrument*Handler` functions if there's one that fits your use
> case.

`withTelemetry` is an all-purpose wrapper around a standard Lambda handler which
adds the appropriate OTel attributes based on the type of event being handled.

> `withTelemetry` specifically knows how to handle API Gateway events, SQS
> events, API Gateway Token Authorizer events, and DynamoDB Stream events. If
> you need other event types, please open an issue. If you're using it with a
> DynamoDB Stream, make sure you've set
> `FunctionResponseTypes: ['ReportBatchItemFailures']` in your CloudFormation
> template.

```ts
import {withTelemetry} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry';

export function handler(event, context) {
    return withTelemetry(
        'handler',
        {attrs: {'com.example.foo': 'bar'}},
        async () => await doSomething(...args)
    );
}
```
