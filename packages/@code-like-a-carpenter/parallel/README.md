## Install

```bash
npm i @code-like-a-carpenter/parallel
```

## Usage

```ts
import {parallelMap} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/parallel';

const result = await parallelMap([1, 2, 3], async (value) => {
    return value * 2;
});
```

Note that exceptions are reported via `captureException` from
`@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry`, but since `parallelMap` uses
`Promise.allSettled` under the hood, they'll never be thrown. If you need to
handle errors, you can either do so one at a time in you callback or you can
iterate through the result and check for failures.
