  # in very small tables where it won't matter that every record is in a single
  # partition. In this case, we're talking about all the plans a startup might
  # offer times 2 for each boolean (cancelled and onFreeTrial), so it's probably
  # less than 20 records. If you find yourself with many more records, you
  # should look at using something other than DynamoDB for aggregating this
